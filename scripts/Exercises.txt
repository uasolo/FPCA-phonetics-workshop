##### 1D series

- ex1
2 categories: PEAK, NO_PEAK
All 100 curves between time 0 and 2. 
Shapes: Large peak common to all curves, followed by a smaller peak only for PEAK category.
Note: some samples are missing.
PC1 taking all the variance

- ex2
As ex1, but the first peak varies independently of Category.
PC1 takes 2/3 of the var, PC2 1/3
PC1 explains variation of the first peak, PC2 the second
So lm is: s2 ~ Category
Note that Category explains 98% of the var of s2, nothing to do with the var explained by PC2 within FPCA
Check what happens to s1 ~ Category.

- ex3
As ex2, but first peak now goes down when second peak (PEAK) goes up.
This is captured by PC1, which is back to explaining most of the var.
A residual of correction term is left to PC2 due to the following:
The NO_PEAK curves must be flat around the 2nd peak, while the 1st can still vary. But PC1 captures the up-down trade-off of peaks 1 and 2. Whenever a NO_PEAK has a low peak 1, PC1 would rise it's peak 2, but it must stay, hence the compensation, clearly visible in the scatter, while for PEAK it's much less clean.

- ex4
Narrow vs. wide peak. 
Note the shape of PC1 !!

- ex5
Early vs. late peak.
Note the shape of the mean!
Note the shape of PC1 !!

- ex6
global mean varies randomly,
up vs. down small peak (small wrt global mean variation)
Note how global mean variation captures all attention of PC1.
The interesting variation of Category is captured by PC2
explaining 0.5% of the var!!
PC1 explains 99.4% of var, but s1 ~ Category R2 = 0.4%
PC2 explains 0.5% of var, but s2 ~ Category R2 = 99%

Try remove global mean from the signal before the analysis.

- ex7

A case where FPCA fails miserably! 
Category is early/late peak, but 5 classes shift the peak position.
Homework: why it fails? Examine PC shapes and scores.
Whould GAMMs succeed? why?
How to overcome the problem with FPCA, if at all possible?


##### 2D series

- ex 1

Trajectory representation in the (y1, y2) plane.
Why is it a straight line? Because (select one and justify):
a) we are using only one score, hence all curves are proportional to each other
b) because y1 and y2 are in this case proportional
c) both a and b.

- ex 2

Finally fun with trajectories that actually go around in circular paths.
Try to justify the shape and the counter/clock-wise direction of each of the two category EMMmeans curves.


###### Land series

- ex 0

Practice with the basic formula for time distorsion, langmark reg,
duration reconstruction.
Three toy datasets of 3 alignments each (no curves!)

- ex 1

early/late peak, curves are identical in physical time,
a landmark is positioned before/after the peak 

1D analysis, compare w/o landmark reg
2D analysis, justify shape of mean_logvel,
reason about the shape of PC1 y and logvel
